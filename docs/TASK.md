# BirdCLEF 2025 Competition Summary

## Overview
BirdCLEF 2025 is a Kaggle competition focused on bird sound recognition. The competition challenges participants to build models that can identify bird species from their calls and songs.

## Data
The competition provides a dataset of bird sound recordings in the `data/birdclef-2025/` directory. The dataset likely includes:

- Training audio files of known bird species
- Test audio files for prediction
- Metadata about recordings (location, time, etc.)
- Taxonomic information about the bird species

## Competition Task
The task appears to be developing a machine learning model that can:
1. Process audio recordings of birds
2. Identify the species making the calls/songs
3. Handle variations in recording quality, background noise, and multiple species

## Code Requirements
While the specific code requirements couldn't be retrieved, typical requirements for this competition likely include:

- Models must process audio data efficiently
- Submissions should follow a specific format (probably CSV with predictions)
- Code should be well-documented and reproducible
- Models should be able to process unlabeled audio (found in `data/unlabeled_audio/`)

## Project Structure
The current project already includes:
- Self-supervised learning modules (`ssl/`)
- Fine-tuning capabilities (`fine-tune/`)
- Testing framework (`test/`)
- Data directories for both labeled and unlabeled audio

## Next Steps
1. Explore the provided audio files to understand the data format
2. Review the existing codebase to understand current capabilities
3. Develop and test models using the provided infrastructure
4. Prepare submissions according to competition guidelines
